# Assessing Sea Ice Thickness Changes around Kivalina, AK Using ICESat-2 ATL10 Gridded Monthly Data

## Name
Ana M. Stringer

## Short Summary
This project aims to analyze the variability and trends in sea ice thickness and wind speeds around Kivalina, Alaska, a region vital for marine subsistence hunting practices. Utilizing ICESat-2 ATL10 gridded monthly data, we will map the spatial distribution of sea ice thickness and investigate its changes over time, alongside wind speed variations, to assess their combined effects on subsistence hunting areas around Kivalina.

## Introduction
The Arctic is experiencing rapid environmental changes due to climate warming, significantly impacting local communities reliant on marine subsistence hunting. Understanding the dynamics of sea ice thickness and wind speed changes is essential for these communities. This project utilizes the ICESat-2 ATL10 dataset to provide a detailed assessment of sea ice thickness variability and wind speed changes around Kivalina, aiming to develop an online climate analysis tool that offers valuable insights into sea ice conditions for the community.

## Problem Statement, Questions, and/or Objectives
The main objectives are to understand the variability and trends in sea ice thickness and wind speeds around Kivalina and how these changes impact marine subsistence hunting areas. The project seeks to answer the following questions:
- How has sea ice thickness around Kivalina changed over time?
- How have wind speeds near Kivalina changed, and what are their implications for sea ice conditions?
- How can we identify the grid cells that cover key hunting areas to focus our analysis?
- What are the implications of sea ice thickness variability and wind speed changes for subsistence hunting practices?
- How can data visualization and analysis tools aid the community in adapting to these environmental changes?

## Datasets
- **ICESat-2 ATL10 Gridded Monthly Sea Ice Products**: This dataset, providing measurements of sea ice thickness, serves as the primary source for assessing changes in sea ice around Kivalina.
- **Wind Speed Data**: Additional datasets will be used to analyze changes in wind speeds near Kivalina over the same period.

## Tools/Packages
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Geopandas and Rasterio**: For spatial analysis of sea ice thickness data and identification of key hunting areas.
- **Streamlit**: For developing an interactive spatial map that visualizes changes in sea ice thickness and wind speeds dynamically.

## Methodology/Approach
1. **Data Processing**: Extract sea ice thickness and wind speed data relevant to Kivalina from the ATL10 dataset and additional sources using Python.
2. **Spatial Analysis**: Map the gridded sea ice thickness data and wind speed data to analyze their spatial distribution and variability over time. Identify grid cells covering key hunting areas for focused analysis.
3. **Interactive Mapping**: Develop an interactive map with Streamlit, enabling dynamic visualization of changes in sea ice thickness and wind speeds.

## Outcomes
The project expects to reveal critical insights into the temporal and spatial variability of sea ice thickness and wind speeds around Kivalina, emphasizing their impacts on marine subsistence hunting areas. The development of an online climate analysis tool will facilitate local community access to sea ice and wind data, aiding in informed decision-making related to subsistence hunting practices.
